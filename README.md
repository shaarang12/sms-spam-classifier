## Dataset
The SMS spam classifier model was trained on a publicly available dataset. You can find more information and download the dataset from the following link: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)(#)

## Machine Learning Model
The machine learning model used for this project is [mention the algorithm or model used, e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, etc.]. The model was trained on the provided dataset and achieved an accuracy of [mention accuracy] on the test set.

To reproduce the model, you can use the provided Jupyter Notebook in the `model` directory.

## Frontend
The frontend of the SMS spam classifier was built using Streamlit. The frontend allows users to input a text message and receive a classification result. It communicates with the machine learning model to provide real-time spam detection.
